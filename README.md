## Hi ! Low level nerd here 

Currently a Rust IoT developper !

At the beginning of March 2022 i was going through the [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s entrance tests, where i had to build a website (first time) from scratch and i really had a blast: it felt like the first "real" touch with programming, my first "real" dive into it. Tons of ideas grew from there.
In 2023 i have then been accepted at Ã‰cole2600 where i discovered a strong interest for low level stuff and especially for exploit developement and reverse engineering.

### How i prepared myself for 2600:
Using TryHackMe, TCM Security Academy, HTB and (not enough but still did) Root-Me ... i have been learning about Cybersecurity.
Using Udemy and Brilliant i have been learning Maths.
Using EdClub i am learning how to type faster.
Using CodeCademy and Charles Severance courses i learned about Python3, SQL and Computer Architecture (my profil can be seen [here](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jeremyperreau)).
