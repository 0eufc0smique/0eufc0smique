## Hi ! I'm a cybersecurity & overall computer-science student

At the beginning of March 2022 i was going through the [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s entrance tests, where i had to build a website (first time) from scratch. I really had a blast: it felt like the first "real" touch with programming, my first "real" dive into it. Tons of ideas grew from there: i started a blog, and a YouTube channel to share my computer science journey (both on "pause" since a lot of months ^^). See <a href="https://jerepe.github.io/my_first_website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> my first website here </a>.
I have then been accepted at Ã‰cole2600 where i discovered a very very strong interest to things like kernel development, building my own CPU on breadboards, and ... exploit developement :))) 

### My experience:
Since mid 2022 i have been studying Python3, SQL, Computer Architecture & Cybersecurity mostly using online courses.
In 2023 i joined Ecole 2600 and have felt in love with low level programming, C and Linux. 

### How i prepared myself for school:
Using TryHackMe, TCM Security Academy, HTB and (not enough but still did) Root-Me ... i have been learning about Cybersecurity.
Using Udemy and Brilliant i have been learning Maths.
Using EdClub i am learning how to type faster.
Using CodeCademy and Charles Severance courses i learned about Python3, SQL and Computer Architecture (my profil can be seen [here](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jeremyperreau)).
