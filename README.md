## Hi !

I'm a computer science student with a project in mental health, and heavy programming skills are required ... 
good because i really felt in love with programming ;)
A (very) strong attraction to programming started at the beginning of March 2022 when doing the [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s
entrance tests and since then decided to go fully in.

### Why ?
Building a website for the first time was quite an exciting experience, and tons of ideas grew from there. You can see it [here](https://jerepe.github.io/my_first_website/).
When learning GitHub Pages i found myself uploading its code back online. That was 100% unexpected and pretty cool ;) 

### Iâ€™m currently working on ...
A personal project in mental health. 
The 7th May 2022 i'll attend [Jedha's Cybersecurity Bootcamp](https://en.jedha.co/formations/cybersecurity-essentials)
The 18th September 2022 i'll start the Holberton School Computer Science program and specialise myself on their blockchain & algorithm program.

### How i prepare myself:
As i write those lines i am finishing a Git & GitHub course
Next comes Python, then SQL.
During the course i'll consolidate my knowledge on other aspects that i talk more in depth on [my blog](https://www.jeremyperreau.com)

### Ask me about :
Anything, what would like to see cover ? I like to make videos where i record myself going through different tests.
I plan on doing as much as possible in the future. From Richard Feynman i learned to enjoy teaching to not only help but 
expand my knowledge.
Next video will be on the last test of CodeCademy [Bash Scripting course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/bash-scripting)
