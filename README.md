## Hi ! I'm a cybersecurity & computer-science student

At the beginning of March 2022 i was going through the [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s entrance tests, where i had to build a website (first time) from scratch. I really had a blast: it felt like the first "real" touch with programming, my first "real" dive into it. Tons of ideas grew from there: i started a blog, and a YouTube channel to share my computer science journey. See <a href="https://jerepe.github.io/my_first_website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> my first website here </a> (both on "pause" since few months).
I have then been accepted at Ã‰cole2600 and since then been preparing myself in order to acquire the skills necessary to go through their program more easily.

### My experience:
I have been studying Python3, SQL, Computer Architecture & Cybersecurity using online courses.
With the recent changes in the tech world i have been much more attracted to AI and plan on taking more math & AI courses to deepen my knowledge and expand my skills into it.
Step by step i'll use those skills to work on personal projects.
I recently started learning about prompt engineering.

### How i prepare myself:
Using TryHackMe and TCM Security Academy i have been learning about Cybersecurity.
Using Udemy and Brilliant i have been learning about Algebra I & II, and will keep doing so until i have learned about Linear Algebra and Calculus (changes could occur).
Using EdClub i am learning how to type faster.
Using CodeCademy and Charles Severance courses i learned about Python3, SQL and Computer Architecture (my profil can be seen [here](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jeremyperreau)). 
Using Andrew Ng courses i will be learning the basics of AI (and maybe use it to further deepen my knowledge).
Using deeplearning.ai i am learning about Prompt Engineering.
