## Hi ! I'm a computer science student

At the beginning of March 2022 i was going through the [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s entrance tests, and we had to build a website (first time), which was a truly exciting experience. 
It felt like the first "real" touch with programming, my first "real" dive into it ... and tons of ideas grew from there. You can see it [here](https://jerepe.github.io/my_first_website/).

### Iâ€™m currently working on ...
A personal project in mental health. 
The 7th May 2022 i'll attend [Jedha's Cybersecurity Bootcamp](https://en.jedha.co/formations/cybersecurity-essentials) and on 18th September 2022 the Holberton School where i'll study more in depth CS and specialise in blockchain & algorithm.
Also, i add to my repos descriptions on why i did things the way i did them, mostly for me to better remember why i did things this way. Publicly journaling ;)

### How i prepare myself:
For now i use mostly [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), and my profil can be seen [here](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jeremyperreau).
As i write those lines i am finishing a [Git & GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) course.
Next comes Python, then SQL.
During the May bootcamp i'll consolidate my knowledge on other aspects, and once done, until the Holberton school start i'll study more in depth cybersecurity by taking on the eJPT certification delivered by the INE, and add some HackTheBox practice.
I'll also add math studies, mostly to increase my mathematical thinking skills. I talk more in depth about that on [my blog](https://www.jeremyperreau.com)

### Ask me about :
Anything! What would like to see cover ? I like to make videos where i record myself going through different tests.
I plan on doing as much as possible in the future. From Richard Feynman i learned to enjoy teaching to not only help but 
expand my knowledge.
Next video will be on the last test of CodeCademy [Bash Scripting course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/bash-scripting).
You can find my previous video going through the last test of CodeCademy "[Learn The Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/)" course [here](https://youtu.be/0U_DLksgi6o).
