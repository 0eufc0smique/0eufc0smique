## Hi ! I'm a computer-science & cybersecurity student

At the beginning of March 2022 i was going through the [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s entrance tests, where i had to build a website (first time) from scratch. I really had a blast: it felt like the first "real" touch with programming, my first "real" dive into it. Tons of ideas grew from there: i started a blog, and a YouTube channel to share my computer science journey. See <a href="https://jerepe.github.io/my_first_website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> my first website here </a> :)

### My experience:
20 hours of Python at the start of 2021. 15 hours of C# at the start of 2022.
I took coding back seriously beginning of March 2022 and since then didn't stop ! ;)))
As of July 2022 i learned about: the CLI, Shell, Zsh, Emacs, scripting, HTML, CSS, JS, and now Python 3.

11/1/22 Update : Currently going through the Codecademy Computer Science learning path & TryHackMe "Complete Beginner" learning path while doing few CTFs here and there on picoCTF.org. I also work full time, but not in anything related to computers & co.

### Also :
Aside a project in mental health, the 7th May 2022 i started studying cybersecurity and pentesting through [Jedha's Cybersecurity Bootcamp](https://en.jedha.co/formations/cybersecurity-essentials) (ends the 26th June 2022).
Also, as a reflection exercise i added to my repositories descriptions on why i did things the way i did them. Publicly journaling ;)

### How i prepare myself:
At the beginning i mostly used [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), and my profil can be seen [here](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jeremyperreau). Currently learning Python 3 using TryHackMe and Udemy in order to pass entrance tests for the Ecole2600.
Once entrance done, i'll finish the TryHackMe Complete Beginner Learning Path.
I'll also add math up to calculus & linear algebra, mostly to increase my mathematical/critical thinking skills. I talk more in depth about that on [my blog](https://www.jeremyperreau.com)
To that i've added a bit of chess daily practice.

### Ask me about :
Anything! What would like to see cover ? I like to make videos where i record myself going through different tests.
I plan on doing as much as possible in the future. From Richard Feynman i learned to enjoy teaching to not only help but 
expand my knowledge.
Next video will be on the last test of CodeCademy [Bash Scripting course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/bash-scripting).
You can find my previous videos going through the last test of CodeCademy "[Learn The Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/)" course [here](https://youtu.be/0U_DLksgi6o) and going through a [Python test on Loops and Lists here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8RElJn5ckM&t=503s)
